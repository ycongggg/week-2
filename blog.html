      <li>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?
          So far, I didn't counter much troubles, and everything goes well.</li>
      <li>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
          I feel excited because it is my first time to develop a website, though it is a very simple one --!
          I paid attention in the lecture, so I remember most rules to follow and editting a html file.</li>
      <li>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
          I think the class Piazza forum is a very good source, since there are so many students in our classes, who are learning the same stuffs. We may counter many similar problems while learning, and Piazza gives us a place to share problems and solutions with peers.</li>
